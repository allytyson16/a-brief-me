    I am christened Adelaide.<br/>
    I am 17 years of age, born on the 4th of October, 2003.<br/>
    If you ask me who I am on a normal day I will tell you I am a gangster, but n a day so special I would say I am a sniper.
    I am a student of the University of Ghana(a school which I am not so happy to be in but anyway, I am there).<br/>
    My hobbies include; dancing, singing out loud(yes, my intention is to disturb my environs).<br/>   
    I wish I could weighlift but you know what society is all about saying and blah blah blah all the time.<br/>
    I wish, like really wish I could improve on my martial arts skill, because who doesn't want to "fight crime, blow bubbles and rescue towns?" but then again, society thinks girls aren't supposed to do things like that.<br/>
    That's a link for my linkedIn; <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/adelaide-panye-yeboah-793152213/"> LinkedIn link.</a>
    I am looking forward to learn a sport and be a pro of course before I am 20.<br/>   
    I am also looking forward to be a <b><i>multimillionaire</i></b> before I am 20.<br/>
    I am also looking forward to be a better writter.<br/>

   <p>God being so good I meet people who already "know road"
    I also have access to certain software applications like Sololearn, Udemy, Cousera, YouTube and Scratch.<br/>
    I also have apps which keep me on my toes like GitHub, because I want to to water my grass(If you know then you know, if you don't know then you dont know)
    I think basically that's it.
